## ⚡ Performance and Efficiency Benchmarks

This section reports the performance on NPU with FastFlowLM (FLM).

> **Note:** 
> - Results are based on FastFlowLM v1.0.0.
> - Under FLM's default NPU power mode (Performance)  
> - Newer versions may deliver improved performance.
> - SmolVLA is a Vision-Language-Action (robotics policy) model. It is measured as end-to-end latency per inference (camera images + instruction → action chunk), not in tokens per second.

### **Test System:** 

AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 370 (Strix Point) with 32 GB DRAM; performance is comparable to other Strix Point and Strix Halo Point systems.

### 🚀 Inference Latency (ms per inference, with different camera input counts)

| **Model**        | **HW**       | **1 image** | **2 images** | **3 images** |
|------------------|--------------------|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| **SmolVLA**  | NPU (FLM)    | 298	| 363	| 430 |
